Hualou Liang, PHD, is a Chair Professor of [Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lst/people/academic-staff/liang-hualou/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk). He is affiliated with the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/). His research is focused on neural data science, machine learning, and biomedical natural language processing. He is known for pioneering the application of causal functional connectivity measures, particularly [Granger causality](https://brain-smart.org/), to the analysis of complex, high-dimensional neuroscience data. 

In recognition of our significant contributions to the development of advanced signal processing methods for the analysis of functional brain networks, he is an elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical Biological Engineering (AIMBE). His recent research on large language models for early detection of cognitive decline has been featured in media outlets such as *Psychology Today, Jerusalem Post, The New York Times, and IEEE Spectrum*.
