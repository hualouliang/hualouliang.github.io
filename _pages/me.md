Hualou Liang, PhD, is a Professor of [Biomedical Engineering](https://drexel.edu/biomed/) at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/). He is affiliated with the [Computational Neuroscience Initiative](https://cni.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/). Dr. Liang was a postdoctoral researcher at [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il), Israel, [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/2549/en), Germany, and [Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/), USA. In 2001, he started his own laboratory at the [University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston](https://www.uth.edu/). He joined the Drexel faculty in 2009. He is known for pioneering the application of causal functional connectivity measures, particularly Granger causality, to the analysis of complex, high-dimensional neuroscience data. He is an elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical Biological Engineering (AIMBE).

His research experience throughout years ranges from areas in biomedical data analysis, machine learning to cognitive and computational neuroscience. His lab explores neural mechanisms of visual perception during various cognitive tasks using computational approaches. His recent work deals with (1) development of [software package](https://brain-smart.org/) for analyzing brain circuits, (2) neuronal oscillations and attentional control, (3) development of advanced signal processing and machine learning methods for the analysis of nonstationary, multivariate neurobiological data (spikes, field potentials, EEG/MEG, fMRI etc), and (4) deep learning for biomedical text mining and analysis of neuroscience big data.
